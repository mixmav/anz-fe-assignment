# ANZ Frontend Engineer Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then ejected using `npm run eject`.

[Live demo](https://anz-fe-assignment.vercel.app/) (hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/))

## Design Decisions

-   Typically, I'd use TailwindCSS, but I've used vanilla CSS for this project to demonstrate my understanding of CSS.

-   TypeScript was used to ensure type safety and to catch errors early.

-   The CSS uses a modified version of the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology for naming conventions, alonsgide CSS modules to prevent conflicts, and make it easier to maintain and scale.

-   Every component was designed with accessibility in mind. For example. ARIA attributes, semantic HTML tags, and focus states for keyboard navigation are all considered.

## Project Structure

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
