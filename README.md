# ANZ Frontend Engineer Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It is also hosted on [Vercel](https://anz-fe-assignment.vercel.app/).

## Design Decisions

-   Typically, I'd use TailwindCSS for styling, but I decided to use plain CSS for this project to demonstrate my understanding of CSS.

-   TypeScript was used to ensure type safety and to make the code more reliable.

-   The CSS adheres to the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) methodology to make it easier to maintain and scale.

-   Accessibility was considered when writing every piece of the code. For example. ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and focus states for keyboard navigation are all used in conjunction.
